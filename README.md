# Excel-and-Tableau Visualization Project
## Data:
For this project, I worked with an open-source dataset titled Wealth of Nations, which comprises information on GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth, and global smartphone usage. I processed and organized the data using Excel, created a worksheet with filtered and refined data, and utilized Tableau to develop an interactive dashboard based on selected tables from the dataset. 

## Objectives:
The objectives include cleaning, formatting, and filtering the dataset using Excel, followed by creating a visual report in Tableau that presents the data through charts and maps tailored to meet the client's requirements.
